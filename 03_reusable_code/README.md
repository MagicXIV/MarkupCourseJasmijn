Deliverable 3: Reusable `R` code wrapped in an `R` package or `Shiny` app.

I made 2 R packages. 
- The first is saveLavaanPlot. You can find it here: 
Development repository: https://github.com/MagicXIV/saveLavaanPlot.git
Package website: https://magicxiv.github.io/saveLavaanPlot/index.html 
	This R package saves and renders plots of models made with the R package lavaan. It is based on the LavaanPlot package. 
	However, at the start, I thought I made a different branch on my repository called "dev". This was not the case, I just renamed the main branch. I found this out "too late"in my judgement, and decided to keep committing to the main/dev branch, and make a slightly different package later with correct GitHub procedure, since now there was unfinished code in my main branch. 
- The second R package is saveLavaanPlot2, and it only saves the plots, it does not render them in the script/viewer environment. You can find the GitHub page here:
